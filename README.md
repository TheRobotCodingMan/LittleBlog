Welcome to LittleNews! We blog about nature, sports, health, space, and many more. We don’t blog about conflicts or political issues since this may effect us and our blogging.
## Important notes
### When We Make The Released Blog
We make blogs likely every 5 to 15 days, and please, a reminder also too, this may take longer. Also, for further details, the current article can be suspended for a month, since we need to gather information about the topic, proofread, and fact test.
### Others
__Note: The website is still under development and problems may occur. If that happends, please make a discussion or/and an issue here on Github or contact me here -- chadrick.tobias22@gmail.com-- This is my personal email, so suspicious emails will not be answered.__
