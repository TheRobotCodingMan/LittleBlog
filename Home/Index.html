      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello, you already read this at the welcome section, but I just want to introduce myself in a more detailed description.
      </p>
      <p>I have learned HTML, CSS, and bit of JavaScript. I am not a master at those but I am a bit, you know, learned. My family is small, I am the only son. We have traveled to different places in the Philippines, since we live there. We found happiness in just small things, so we are mostly in good moods.
      </p>
      <h3>My Dream</h3>
      <p>I have different dreams in my life. When I was 3 to 6 years old, I like to be an police officer that control the flow of the intersection of the roads. 6 to 8 years old, I want to became a scientist, a geologist. But it was different now, 9 to my current age, I like coding. I also like to play the piano before. Drawing is one of few things I like a bit still. I also like watching Youtube.
      </p>
