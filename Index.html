        <div class="Latestnewstxt">
          <p>Welcome to LittleNews! Since this is our first day, we want to give you a bit of news. Those who like nature and want to stop climate change, there's a way to stop it! Based on the youtube channel <em>Kurzgesagt</em> and also scientists, there's a way, but it's hard, super.
            Many ways are shown in the process so we'll link Kurzgesagt's video below <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-down"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-down"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-down"></i>

         <p>Ohhh... okay. Kurzgesagt wants to emphasize that <em>there are a few ways</em>, but... it's hard. It says that businessmen and politicians don't focus on stopping it, some countries may, but not all do. Lots of bad gases, such as Carbon Dioxide, Methane, Nitrous Oxide, and Fluorinated Gases, are released into the atmosphere, by cars, factories, airplanes, and many more. We had already destroyed our small planet, but most high-ups doesn't even care a bit! Forest fires, bad garbage disposal, and high concentrations of carbon dioxide. I tell you, if the small list makes you a bit sad, that's just 3 of the whole long list! It may seems we're doomed... but again, no. Even if giving up maybe is good for you, keep hold of it!
Because we just emit so much of those bad gases I tell you about earlier, it's covering the atmosphere. Those gases doesn't come all from your family, neighborhood, or city... but all from 7.7 billions of us! For more info from UN, go <a href="https://www.un.org/en/global-issues/population" target="_blank"><strong>here</strong></a>. UN also forecast that we only had <strong>3</strong> years to act, to stop runaway climate change. For more info again, visit <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsta.2012.0004">this</a>, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/science/2018/08/06/hothouse-earth-runaway-global-warming-threatens-habitability-planet/916521002/">this</a>, <a href="https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/what-is-climate-change">this</a>, and <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/sources-can-we-fix-climate/">this</a>. They were trusted sources, so don't be hesitant to read it.
        </p>
        <p>So if you don't wanna read it, you can read mine. I'll keep it short and a few pages long. So c'mon, let's go!
        </p>
        <p>In order to have knowledge, I have read different sources. And continuing what I am saying. We are the cause of the global climate change and many other species are dying, so we should fix it, right? But in our current situation, the world is like preparing for the worst. Organizations and countries have set laws and regulations, spread the news we should act now, and build windmills, solar panels, safe nuclear plants, and more, but it's not enough. Everyone is not doing it. Places like Africa have lots of issues about energy, learning, and nutrition. So how places like this even efficiently stop the global problem, when they face others too?

      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello, you already read this at the welcome section, but I just want to introduce myself in a more detailed description.
      </p>
      <p>I have learned HTML, CSS, and bit of JavaScript. I am not a master at those but I am a bit, you know, learned. My family is small, I am the only son. We have traveled to different places in the Philippines, since we live there. We found happiness in just small things, so we are mostly in good moods.
      </p>
      <h3>My Dream</h3>
      <p>I have different dreams in my life. When I was 3 to 6 years old, I like to be an police officer that control the flow of the intersection of the roads. 6 to 8 years old, I want to became a scientist, a geologist. But it was different now, 9 to my current age, I like coding. I also like to play the piano before. Drawing is one of few things I like a bit still. I also like watching Youtube.
